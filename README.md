# 3DGrapher - Prototype
3D Graphing Calculator app written in Python and Qt with scipy-powered interpolation for undefined graph areas.

In development. Features to be added include:
- Tick marks and numbers on axes
- User-defined variables as well as function composition
- User-defined bounds/intervals
- Desmos-style table for defining variables and equations
- Graph options such as colormap, resolution, transparency, etc..
- Print current graph and equations
- Interpolating values at undefined areas/limits, warning user that graph may be undefined at some areas
- Additional graph types including 2D/3D versions of: cartesian space, spherical space, contour plots, vector fields
- Save/Load workspaces, equations, and save app state when app is closed and re-opened
- *Maybe*.... Heat flow visualizer for rectangular plates and 3d cartesian space
